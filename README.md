 The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well-known optimization problem which consists in finding the 
 shortests Hamiltonian Cycle in a graph. Since this problem is NP-hard, it will be very time consuming to 
 solve large instances using linear programming with guaranteed optimizality. Therefore, we can use 
 \heuristics and metaheurtics to solve the problem. However, we have to set optimality aside. 
 On this project, we compare five different algorithms (Cutting Plane Method, GRASP, Tabu search, 
 Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony) to solve a multi-objective TSP, but using a mono-objective function.
